One of the most beautiful calculators you've ever seen in your life, very functional too, you can add, subtract numbers and even multiply and divide them, it's just mind-blowing, I know.

This masterpiece is written in HTML5, CSS3 and JS.

P.S. There are little easter eggs hidden in the calculator.
